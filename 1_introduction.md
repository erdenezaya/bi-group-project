# 1. Introduction
For this project, we’re diving into the World Bank’s Global Findex 2025 data to take a closer look at financial inclusion around the world. Our goal? To dig into a few research questions (suggested by our group) and find out what the numbers actually tell us.

- like the gender gap in access to financial services.
- digital device mobile 
- salary across the world

We’re kicking things off by cleaning and transforming the data in Power BI. After that, we’ll zero in on a few key indicators that show meaningful trends—things like differences across countries, regions, and income levels.

Next up: building an interactive dashboard that helps us (and others) spot those patterns and explore the data more easily.

We’re also putting together a report to explain what we did, what we found, and why it matters. To keep things clear, we added a few extras in the appendix—like a data dictionary and some dashboard screenshots—so everything’s easy to follow.

The workflow of group projects:
- Explore dataset → shortlist variables.
- Define storyline / research question, focus.
- Clean dataset & rename key columns.
- Build visuals in Power BI.
- Draft report sections in Markdown.
- Merge, polish, and export PDF.
- Submit deliverables.

### Purpose of the Report
