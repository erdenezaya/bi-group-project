# 1. Introduction
For this project, we’re diving into the World Bank’s Global Findex 2025 dataset to explore financial inclusion on a global scale. Our main focus is to tackle a specific research questions as suggested below by group members, and see what the data reveals:

- like the gender gap in access to financial services.
- digital device mobile 
- salary across the world

We’ll start by cleaning and transforming the dataset in Power BI, then pick out a few key indicators that really highlight trends across countries, regions, and income levels. From there, we’ll build an interactive dashboard that makes it easy to visualize those patterns and dig deeper into the insights.

Alongside the dashboard, we’re putting together a written report that walks through our process, explains what we found, and reflects on what it all means. We’ve also included extra materials in the appendix like a data dictionary and some dashboard screenshot to keep everything transparent and easy to follow.

The workflow of group projects:
- Explore dataset → shortlist variables.
- Define storyline / research question.
- Clean dataset & rename key columns.
- Build visuals in Power BI.
- Draft report sections in Markdown.
- Merge, polish, and export PDF.
- Submit deliverables.
