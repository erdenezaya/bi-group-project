## ✍️ Contribution Guide

Contributing is **easier than Google Docs**:
1. Open the `.md` file for your section in VS Code (e.g., `2_background.md`).
2. Write your content under the provided headings.
3. Save the file.
4. Upload (commit + push) your changes here:  
   👉 [https://github.com/erdenezaya/bi-group-project](https://github.com/erdenezaya/bi-group-project)

Preview your changes in VS Code with:
- `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows)  
- `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac)

> Each member only edits their own file — no copy/paste clashes or overwriting.

For full details, see [guide-how-to-contribute.md](./guide-how-to-contribute.md).
