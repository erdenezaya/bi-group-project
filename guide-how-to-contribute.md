# Quick Guide â€“ How to Contribute

This is **easier than working on Google Docs**:  
ðŸ‘‰ You only edit your own file, press save, and push it to GitHub. No messy copy-paste, no version conflicts.

## 1. Files
Each part of the report is in its own file:
- `0_title_page.md` -  #Zaya 
- `1_introduction.md` - #  Brief. Purpose of the project, Problem defintion -> Zaya , Huang,
- `2_background.md` -   #  Exploring dataset, how we collect, -> Huang Jinshu
- `3_methodology.md` -  #  600words data pre-processing steps -> Huang(Data processing.), Gedion
- `4_solution.md` -     #  Dashboard Gedion, Zaya
- `5_discussion.md` -   #  -> All members 
- `6_references.md`     #  -> All members should note own sources and put here.
- `appendix.md`

## 2. How to Edit
1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Click the file with your section (e.g., `2_background.md`).  
3. Write your content under the headings.  
   - `##` = section title  
   - `###` = subsection  
   - `-` = bullet point  
   - `**bold**` = bold text

## 3. Preview
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac) to preview.  
- What you see is how it will look in the final report.

---

## 4. Save & Upload
1. Just **save** your file in VS Code.  
2. Upload (commit/push) changes to our shared repo:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/erdenezaya/bi-group-project](https://github.com/erdenezaya/bi-group-project)

---

## 5. Building the Report
- The editor will run the script (`compile_report.py`).  
- It merges all sections into one (`report_merged.md`) and exports a PDF.  
- You donâ€™t need to worry about merging â€” just edit your own file.

âœ… Thatâ€™s it. Much simpler than Google Docs: no version clashes, no overwriting, and everything stays organised.
